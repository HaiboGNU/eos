FEATURES
--------
So far, the supported operations are :
  mkdir, rmdir, delete, rename, cksm (checksum), chmod  
Any other operation is not implemented and will result in an error.

Some eos specifics can be enabled.
More generally, the configuration of the plugin is 
written in the file /etc/sysconfig/xrootd-gridftp-server.

the testing is based on uberftp:
warning!! the test has been reported working with uberftp 2.6 but NOT working with uberftp 2.4
(take care that 2.4 is the version currently installed on slc5)

OS
--
This plugin has been successfully tested
- on SLC6 with eos specifics
- on SLC6 with a pure XRootD server
- on SLC5 with a pure XRootD server
Because of CMake, it sould be possible to compile it without any significant change on any OS
provided with gcc > 4.4 or an equivalent compiler.

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
This plugin has been developped and tested with globus-gridftp-server-devel 6.19-1 and XRootD 3.3.1-1

To run this plugin, the following packages are required:
- xrootd-cl
- globus-gridftp-server-progs

To Build this pluginm the following packages are required:
- globus-gridftp-server-devel
- xrootd-cl-devel
- gcc > 4.4

Minimum versions for these packages are not known.
The testing script requires uberftp >= 2.6

INSTALL
-------
Create an empty build directory anywhere then run cmake. It should look like
> mkdir -p /path/to/build/dir
> cd /path/to/build/dir
> cmake /path/to/cmake.install/.

Then there are several possible targets for make : all(default), clean, install, uninstall, dist, srpm, rpm
For instance, to build the binary rpm, you should type 
> cd /path/to/build/dir
> make rpm

FILE TREE
---------
  - src/			: source code
  - cmake/			: cmake helpers for the build process
  - etc/			: config and service files 
  - doxygen/		: the directory to build the doxy documentation
  - test/			: a testing script to unitary test each feature and to stress test some of them 
  - CMakeLists.txt	: the CMake source file to make the build process
  - xroot-dsi.spec	: the spec file to build the rpm
  - README          : the current file

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The documentation is split out into several files, namely :
- the current file for some general information
- the doxy documentation (to build it, just go to the doxygen/ subdir and run doxygen)
- comments in the source code for code related informations
- the files in the subdir etc/, especially etc/sysconfig/xrootd-gridftp-server 
  which should be meaningful for the configuration of the plugin and the eos specifics

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
--------------------------
- because the Xrd Client is asynchronous, the code of the plugin is multithreaded. 
  then, the threading should be turned on in the gridftp server (see the provided init script)
- even if it has an offset argument, it seems that globus_gridftp_server_register_write()   
  cannot be called out-of-order. The implementation of the plugin for send op is asynchronous and
  a simple mechanism has been implemented to turn it synchronous. If this limitation disappears,
  the plugin can be turned asynchronous but it requires to recompile. It's on purpose.
