Introduction
=======================

The EOS project was started in April 2010 in the IT DSS group. The main goal of the project is to provide fast and reliable disk only storage technology for CERN LHC use cases.

The first release version 0.1 has been put into production in June 2010. Since release version 0.1.1 EOS is now available under GPL v3 license. We run currently five EOS instances at CERN and one at FERMILAB based on the 0.2 amber release.
