   *EOS* is a simple storage software solution to manage multi PB storage. Core of the implementation is the *XRootD* framework a providing feature-rich remote access protocol. 
   The storage system is running on commodity hardware with disks in *JBOD* configuration. Default mode of operation is to store files with two replicas. 
   *EOS Version BERYLL* supports also flexible erasure encoding of files with two or three redundancy stripes optimizing disk space usage. Files can be accessed via native XRootD protocol, a POSIX-like *FUSE* client or *HTTP(S) & WebDav* protocol.
